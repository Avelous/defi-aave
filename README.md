# defi-aave lending Repo

This project is designed to interact with aave lending protocol. It allows the deposit of collateral in ETH/WETH which earns yield, borrowing of another asset and repaying the asset. The asset illustrated here is DAI

**Note**: Mainnet is forked to simulate the interaction on development chains. This project will work only on mainnet or forked mainnet. Testnet chains are depracated due to eth merge at the time of writing
